# Perceptron Learning Algorithm

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Perceptron Learning Algorithm in C#. The perceptron is a type of artificial neural network used for binary classification tasks. This implementation demonstrates how to train a perceptron to classify data points into two classes based on a linear decision boundary.

## Features

- **Binary Classification**: Train a perceptron to classify data points into two classes.
- **Weight Adjustment**: Dynamically adjusts weights and bias based on the training data.
- **Convergence Check**: Automatically stops training when the perceptron converges or the maximum number of epochs is reached.
- **Performance Metrics**: Displays the final weights, bias, number of epochs, learning rate, and training time.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 6.0 SDK or higher
- Visual Studio or any C# compatible IDE

## Code Overview

- **Program.cs**: Contains the main logic for the perceptron learning algorithm, including data initialization, training loop, utility functions, and scaling.
